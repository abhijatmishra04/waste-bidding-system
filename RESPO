Hi Milind,

As per our discussion, we need the updated requirements and decommissioning details for the SDP request. Could you please confirm the following so we can proceed correctly?
	1.	Finalized Requirements – Please provide the latest document with all approved changes.
	2.	Decommissioned Logic Details – List of steps that were removed or modified in the mainframe and need to be excluded from the Java migration.
