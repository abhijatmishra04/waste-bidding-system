1. Get the current date and time:
   - Use `ZonedDateTime.now(ZoneId.systemDefault())` to retrieve the current date and time in the system's default time zone.
   - This ensures the timestamp aligns with the server's local time.

2. Convert the current date and time to a database-friendly format:
   - Use `Timestamp.valueOf(now.toLocalDateTime())` to convert the `ZonedDateTime` object into a `Timestamp` object.
   - This step is necessary for storing the date-time value in a database or other systems that use `Timestamp`.

3. Set the calculated timestamp in the staging table:
   - Call the method `setSchdCreatTs(calculatedSchdCreatTs)` on the `stagingTable` object.
   - This sets the "Scheduled Creation Timestamp" (`SchdCreatTs`) in the staging table with the calculated value.

4. Ensure the data is ready for further operations or persistence:
   - The `stagingTable` now has the current timestamp stored in the `SchdCreatTs` field, ready for subsequent use in the application or database.
