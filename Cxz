Hey folks 👋,

I’ve put together a Python utility for calling the RAI Gateway and pushed it to GitHub.

Instead of everyone writing their own retry logic, error handling, or metrics, this utility takes care of it out of the box:
	•	🔄 Retries + backoff so it doesn’t hammer the gateway when things fail
	•	🚦 Circuit breaker to stop flooding if the service is down
	•	📊 Metrics (latency avg/p50/p95, success rate, failures, etc.)
	•	📝 JSON logging that’s clean and safe
	•	🔑 Auth handled automatically (works with PAT / config)

All you need to do is plug in your rai_config.cfg, call client.call_chat(...), and you’re good to go. You can also check client.get_metrics() anytime for live stats.

This should make our RAI calls more reliable and easier to monitor across projects. Let me know your thoughts — happy to help if anyone wants to try it out. 🚀
