Subject: Thank You & Farewell – Moving to a New Project

Dear Team,

Today marks my last day on this project, and as I transition to a new opportunity within the organization, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to each one of you.

Working with such a talented, collaborative, and supportive group has been an enriching experience. I’ve learned a lot from all of you, and I truly appreciate the guidance, encouragement, and camaraderie that made this journey both enjoyable and rewarding.

Though I’m moving to a different project, I’ll always be happy to support you in any way I can. Please feel free to reach out to me for anything — I’d be glad to help whenever possible.

Wishing you all continued success and looking forward to crossing paths again in the future!
