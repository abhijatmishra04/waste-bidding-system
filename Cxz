Hi Ugandhar,

I received a call from Infosys HR, Sankha, regarding a 16% retention hike. I am open to continuing with Infosys, provided this retention hike is approved along with an immediate release from my current project.

As discussed earlier, I have clearly communicated my reasons for seeking a release. Additionally, I have significantly upskilled myself in AI/ML, Generative AI, and cloud technologies. I have earned multiple external certifications, including:
	•	AWS Developer Associate
	•	AWS Solutions Architect Associate
	•	NVIDIA Associate in Generative AI and LLMs

With this expertise, I believe I can contribute effectively to both Java/machine learning hybrid roles as well as dedicated AI/ML positions. Infosys stands to benefit greatly from my enhanced skillset.

Looking forward to your support.
