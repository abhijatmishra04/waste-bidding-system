ðŸ“§ Subject: Onboarding Blocked for State Street Due to BofA HDD Restrictions

Hi ,

I hope youâ€™re doing well.

I am currently in the process of transitioning from the BofA account to the State Street project. While my last working day in the BofA account is officially set as 24th July, the onboarding process for State Street has already begun.

However, I am currently facing a blocker in completing the Sterling background verification, as I am unable to upload the required documents through the portal. The issue seems to be caused by existing BofA HDD and hardening policies on my laptop, which are restricting access to the Sterling upload functionality.

I kindly request your support in helping me with either:
	1.	Getting temporary access or permissions to complete the Sterling upload,
or
	2.	Providing an alternative solution so I can continue with my State Street onboarding without delays.

Please let me know how to proceed. This is currently holding back my onboarding timeline, and I would really appreciate your quick guidance.

Thank you for your support.
